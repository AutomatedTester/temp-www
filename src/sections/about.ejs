            <h2 id="motivation">About Nightwatch</h2>
          </div>
          <p>Nightwatch was published in January 2014, initially created by <a rel="noreferrer" href="https://twitter.com/andreirusu_" target="_blank">Andrei Rusu</a> as a tool to enable writing of automated UI tests in a straightforward way, and which will require as little configuration and additional libraries as possible.</p>
          <p>
            Right after it was published, <strong>Nightwatch</strong> has seen steady growth and has now become one of the most popular Node.js end-to-end testing solutions for web applications and websites.
          </p>

          <p>
            From the very <a href="https://github.com/nightwatchjs/nightwatch/issues/1" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">first Github Issue</a> opened by <a rel="noreferrer" href="https://twitter.com/youyuxi" target="_blank">Evan You</a> (creator of <a href="https://vuejs.org" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Vue.js</a>) and seamless integration with the Vue.js framework, to being featured on the <a href="https://twitter.com/nightwatchjs/status/920585197137088512" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">2017 ThoughtWorks Technology Radar</a>,
            <strong>Nightwatch</strong> has become an established household name in the wider automated testing industry.
          </p>

          <h3><span>Our Vision</span></h3>
          <div class="vision">
          <p>
            Instead of building a highly flexible tool which supports a lot of plugins and customization we aim to deliver a tool that is packed with everything you need out of the box.
          </p>

          <p>
            We believe that in order to write tests you should only focus on writing tests and not have to add multiple external plugins and dependencies. In our experience, this usually leads to increasingly more time spent on maintaining dependencies and solving configuration issues, instead of writing actual tests.
          </p>
          <p>
            We do however provide mechanisms to <a href="/guide/extending-nightwatch/">extend the existing API commands and assertions</a> when needed and you can also <a href="/guide/running-tests/#programmatic-api">use Nightwatch programmatically</a> if you wish.
            We also do our best to ensure that Nightwatch follows an industry agreed upon practice and we try to be compatible with other existing tools.
          </p>

          <p>
            You can even write <a href="/guide/unit-testing-with-nightwatch/">Node.js unit tests</a> in Nightwatch to test your backend APIs. These tests are using the same assertion libraries and the same syntax and runner.
            We can even combine end-to-end tests with unit/integration tests in the same test run.
          </p>

            <h2 id="roadmap">Roadmap</h2>
          </div>
          <div class="roadmap">
            <h4>Current Version - 1.2</h4>
            <p>
              Progress regarding the issues being worked on from the current version can be tracked on <a href="https://github.com/nightwatchjs/nightwatch/projects/2" target="_blank">Github Projects</a>.
              The focus in this version was to stabilize the existing <code>waitForElement</code> and other element related commands and improve the compatibility with the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/webdriver/" target="_blank">WebDriver API</a>, particularly for window related commands.
            </p>

            <p>More details on the v1.2 release can be found on the <a href="https://github.com/nightwatchjs/nightwatch/releases/tag/v1.2.1" target="_blank">Github release pages</a>.</p>

            <h4>Version 1.3</h4>

            <p>We plan on continuing to improve the compatibility with the Webdriver API and the cross-browser testing support.
              In addition we hope to address some of the issues related to concurrency, particularly in Firefox.</p>

            <p>At the same time, we are working on adding BDD <code>describe</code> interface for writing tests, as we believe this will make users (especially new ones) a bit more comfortable with writing tests in a well-known syntax.</p>

            <p>You can follow the development progress on <a href="https://github.com/nightwatchjs/nightwatch/projects/3" target="_blank">Github Projects</a></p>

            <h4>Version 1.4</h4>
            <p>We are currently planning the roadmap for the <strong>v1.4</strong> release but we hope that either this version, or a potential <strong>v2</strong> instead, will include support for <a href="https://nightcloud.io">Nightcloud.io</a> - our upcoming cloud testing service.</p>

            <h4>Nightcloud.io</h4>
            <p>Development of our own cloud testing platform <a href="https://nightcloud.io">Nightcloud.io</a> is slowly but surely moving forward. Perhaps not at the same speed as a full dev team working in a properly funded company but rest assured that it is progressing. </p>
            <p>We have made the decision to try and grow the platform organically, without using external funding. We are building <strong>Nightcloud</strong> at the same time that we maintaing <strong>Nightwatch</strong> and we hope to be ready with the Beta release by the end of 2019.</p>
            <p>We are however open to partnership suggestions and we'd be happy to discuss any ideas or proposals. <a href="https://pineview.io/#contact" target="_blank">Drop us a line</a> if you're interested in partnering with us for the development of Nightcloud.</p>

            <h2 id="support-us">Support Nightwatch</h2>
          </div>
          <div class="sponsor">
          <p>
            <strong>Nightwatch</strong> is maintained by an <a href="https://pineview.io" target="_blank">independent software consultancy</a> based in Oslo, Norway, without any major corporate developer powerhouse behind it, nor any VC to influence its roadmap.
            The maintainers and the larger community of users and contributors have sole responsibility for the roadmap and direction of Nightwatch.
          </p>

          <p>
            However, the team behind Nightwatch spends <i>dozens</i> (often hundreds) of hours per month working on <i>bug fixes</i>, <i>enhancements</i>, <i>verifying PRs and issues on Github</i>, <i>writing documentation</i>, <i>answering support requests</i> and other maintenance tasks.
            We are doing this for over five years now and will continue to do so, but your support could boost our efforts and it would enable us to spend even more time on developing the framework.
          </p>

          <p>
            There are several ways in which your company (or you as an individual) can support Nightwatch financially. You can become a backer or your company can sponsor Nightwatch on the <a href="https://opencollective.com/nightwatch"><strong>Open Collective</strong></a> platform (or an alternative sponsorship platform).
            You can also hire the <a href="https://pineview.io/about">Core Team</a> to provide training and consulting for your project.
